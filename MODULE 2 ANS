QUIZ 4

Question 1: A user data packet transmitted during a PDU session passes through a node implementing a function (select 2 answers):
gNB
UPF (User Plane Function)

Question 2: Indicate the functional entities with which the UE exchanges signalling directly or indirectly. Indirect exchange means that the message may pass through an intermediary which merely relays it, i.e. receives and forwards it without analysing the content (select 3 answers):
AMF (Access and Mobility management Function)
gNB
SMF (Session Management Function)

Question 3: Consider a 5G network connected to an IP-based Packet Data Network (PDN). The allocation of the IP address to the UE is done by:
SMF (Session Management Function)

Question 4: The UDM (Unified Data Management function):
Manages subscriber identification and subscription management.

QUIZ 5 

Question 1: In 5G, the AUSF and UDM:
Correspond to functions that can be executed either on the same machine or on different machines.

Question 2: Elasticity is a property that characterizes:
A functional breakdown where function instances can be dynamically started or stopped according to the current network load.

3.Virtualization of network functions is supported:
Through the use of the HTTP protocol between the functional entities of the 5G core network and stateless servers.

QUIZ 6 

Question 1: In 5G, the PCF is:

The Policy Control Function.
Question 2: Consider a 5G subscriber who goes abroad. The scenario is "Home Routed". When a data flow is established with a quality-of-service level (e.g. minimum data rate guarantee):

The two PCFs (vPCF and hPCF) intervene.
Question 3: In 5G, the Network-function Repository Function (NRF):

Allows an entity to determine the entities providing a given service.
Question 4: Consider a company S that wants to offer a particular service whenever someone turns on their 5G terminal:

It addresses the 5G operator to be notified of the "power on" event.
Question 5: In the previous case, the service platform of company S communicates with:

The NEF (Network Exposure Function).
