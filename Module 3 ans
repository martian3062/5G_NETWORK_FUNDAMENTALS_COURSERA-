Q1: The 5G‑NR interface is based on
Answer: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
Explanation: 5G New Radio uses OFDM as its modulation scheme to provide high spectral efficiency and robust performance in multipath environments.
Q3: The duration of an OFDM symbol is
Answer: inversely proportional to the spacing between subcarriers
Explanation: In OFDM, the symbol duration T is given by T = 1/Δf, where Δf is the subcarrier spacing.
Q4: A large subcarrier spacing (large numerology) should be used from 6 GHz onwards because (select 2 answers)
Answers:
the available band is wider as you go up in frequency
small cells are deployed above 6 GHz where the excess delays are small
Explanation: At higher frequencies, there is generally a larger contiguous bandwidth available and deployments tend to use small cells (with lower delay spreads), both of which favor larger subcarrier spacings.
Q5: For NR numerology 1 (30‑kHz spacing) with 324 subcarriers, the approximate bandwidth is
Answer: 9.72
Explanation: Multiplying 324 subcarriers by 30 kHz gives 9720 kHz, or 9.72 MHz.

S2.V2.Q1: A sub-frame in NR has a duration equal to 1 ms.

✅ Answer: has a duration equal to 1 ms
S2.V2.Q2: A time slot in NR depends on the numerology.

✅ Answer: has a duration that depends on the numerology
S2.V2.Q3: In NR, a UE can be allocated one or more resource blocks per slot.

✅ Answer: one or more resource blocks at each slot
S2.V2.Q4: A resource block (RB) in NR consists of 12 subcarriers and 14 symbols (for normal CP).
Answer: corresponds to 12 subcarriers and any number of successive symbols

Beamforming is based on:

The use of antenna arrays
Beamforming involves using multiple antennas (antenna arrays) to direct signal transmission or reception in specific directions, enhancing signal strength and reducing interference.

The beam is more narrow:

If the number of antenna elements is increased
Increasing the number of antenna elements in an array allows for a narrower beam, providing better directionality and improved signal focus. 
COMMSCOPE.COM

Consider a first transmission with only one antenna and power P. Now consider an array of 2 antenna elements, the same total power, and ideal beamforming. Compared to the initial case, the power received by a terminal at a given distance (assumed far from the antennas) is:

Question 1 (S2.V4.Q1)
Scenario: The base station has an antenna array, and you need to determine in which configuration it is possible to serve both terminals simultaneously using MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO).

Answer: Based on the line-of-sight propagation assumption and the antenna array setup, it seems that Option C is the correct answer. This configuration would likely support both terminals due to the line-of-sight setup and no obstructions.
Question 2 (S2.V4.Q2)
Scenario: Now considering propagation with obstacles and only one path per terminal.

Answer: The correct option here would be Option B. This setup, where both terminals have one path each, is more likely to support MU-MIMO simultaneously than the other configurations.
Question 3 (S2.V4.Q3)
Scenario: In a network with 8-antenna base stations and 2-antenna terminals, how many simultaneous streams can a terminal receive at most?

Answer: Given the scenario with 8 antennas at the base station and 2 at the terminal, the maximum number of streams the terminal can receive would be 2 streams, as each antenna at the terminal can receive a stream.
Question 4 (S2.V4.Q4)
Scenario: Under the same conditions, how many simultaneous streams can a terminal transmit at most?

Answer: Similar to the previous question, under the same conditions, the terminal can transmit 2 streams at most.
Question 5 (S2.V4.Q5)
Scenario: The maximum number of streams per terminal is used. How many different terminals at most can be served on the same time-frequency resources?

Answer: Since the base station has 8 antennas, and each terminal can have 2 streams, 4 terminals can be served at most simultaneously on the same time-frequency resources.

In 5G-NR, to indicate to which terminal a resource is allocated, the gNB specifies:

Answer: The RNTI allocated to the terminal.
The RNTI (Radio Network Temporary Identifier) is used to identify a terminal in 5G NR. It is allocated to the terminal to indicate the resources assigned to it.
Question 2
In 5G-NR, the Downlink Control Information (DCI) message indicates the allocated resource:

Answer: In the time slot specified by the time domain assignment field.
The DCI message provides information regarding the resource allocation, and it specifies the time slot for the allocation through the time domain assignment field.
Question 3
In 5G-NR, the Downlink Control Information (DCI) message:

Answer: Can be beam-formed to a particular terminal.
In 5G NR, beamforming is used to target the DCI message to a specific terminal, optimizing the signal's strength and quality for that terminal.
Question 4
In 5G-NR, the protocol stack:

Answer: Contains an additional layer called SDAP.
The 5G NR protocol stack includes a new layer called SDAP (Service Data Adaptation Protocol), which is introduced to handle the mapping between QoS flows and data bearers.
