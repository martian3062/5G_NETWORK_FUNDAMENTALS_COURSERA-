 1. CUPS consists of
separating the control and data planes for the nodes concerned by user data flow

 2. In a 5G CUPS architecture, the UPF
applies the routing policy sent by the SMF

3. In CUPS architecture, a UPF
 systematically receives from the SMF a set of rules defining the forwarding and QoS management for each new data flow

Question 1: In CUPS architecture,

Answer: the 32-bit TEID is retained to identify each endpoint of the tunnel but the SEID is added to uniquely identify a session
Explanation: In the CUPS architecture, the 32-bit Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID) is maintained to identify each endpoint of 
the tunnel. Additionally, a 64-bit Session Endpoint Identifier (SEID) is introduced to uniquely identify a session, enhancing the
granularity and management of sessions within the network. 

Question 2: The Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) operates over

Answer: UDP
Explanation: PFCP operates over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It is a signaling protocol used 
for communication between control plane and user plane functions in 4G and 5G networks, facilitating the implementation of
Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS). 

Question 3: A PFCP message sent by an SMF to a UPF

Answer: is never lost because PFCP includes a retransmission process
Explanation: PFCP includes a retransmission mechanism to ensure reliable message delivery. If a PFCP message sent by a 
Session Management Function (SMF) to a User Plane Function (UPF) is not acknowledged, it will be retransmitted
according to the protocol's retransmission strategy. 

Question 4: The association between an SMF and a UPF

Answer: is done when a new SMF or UPF instance is started
Explanation: The association between a Session Management Function (SMF) and a User Plane Function (UPF) is 
established when a new SMF or UPF instance is started. This association is necessary for the SMF to manage sessions
and control the user plane functions effectively.

In CUPS architecture, TEID:

The correct answer is: can be chosen by the SMF or the UPF depending on the configuration choice

Regarding the TEID local to the gNB (to the radio access network):

The correct answer is: chosen by the gNB and transmitted to the UPF via AMF and SMF

1. In 5G, 
PDU session establishment may be done after registering in the network

2. The functional entities necessarily involved in the registration of a UE in the network are:

AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function)
AUSF (Authentication Server Function)
gNB (Next Generation NodeB)
UDM (Unified Data Management)

3. The functional entities necessarily involved in establishing a PDU session are:

AMF
gNB
SMF (Session Management Function)

m3l5
When a UE changes from "CM-idle/RRC-idle" to "CM-connected/RRC-Connected" state:

The following entities exchange messages (in addition to the UE):

AMF

gNB

The AMF and gNB are involved in establishing the NAS signaling connection and RRC connection respectively25. The other entities (AUSF, SMF, UDM, UPF, NRF) 
are not directly involved in this state transition.

In "RRC-inactive" state, the following connections and tunnels are maintained:

gNB-AMF connection

gNB-UPF tunnel

In RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE context is stored in both the UE and the last serving gNB. The gNB maintains the NG connections (NG-C and NG-U) with the AMF and UPF47.

Reasons for defining a new RRC state (RRC_INACTIVE) in 5G:

To limit the demands on the core network entities, in particular the AMF

To reduce latency when exchanging data after a period of inactivity

m3l6
Given a terminal in RRC-Connected state, what identity is allocated to it by the radio access network (the gNB)?

The correct answer is:

an RNTI

In RRC_CONNECTED state, the gNB allocates a Cell Radio Network Temporary Identifier (C-RNTI) to the UE. This C-RNTI is
used as an identifier for the RRC connection and for scheduling purposes3.

In which state or states does the gNB maintain a context for a UE?

The correct answers are:

RRC-inactive
RRC-connected

In RRC_CONNECTED state, the gNB maintains full context for the UE. In RRC_INACTIVE state, the AS context is stored
by both UE and gNB4. The gNB does not maintain context for UEs in RRC_IDLE state.

A UE in the RRC-inactive state wants to send a data stream,

The correct answer is:

it must perform a random access procedure so that an RNTI is allocated to it and then it can transmit the flow

When a UE in RRC_INACTIVE state wants to send data, it needs to perform a random access procedure to transition back to RRC_CONNECTED state.
This involves sending an RRC Resume Request to the gNB, which then allocates a new C-RNTI to the UE before data transmission can begin

S3.DS.Q1: In a 5G CUPS-type architecture
The correct answer is:

each UPF applies the routing policy sent by the SMF

Explanation:

In a 5G CUPS (Control and User Plane Separation) architecture, the UPF (User Plane Function) operates based on routing policies 
provided by the SMF (Session Management Function). The SMF defines and sends these policies to ensure proper data routing and QoS management56.

S3.DS.Q2: The Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) operates on top of UDP. In case of packet loss on the network between an SMF and a UPF
The correct answer is:

PFCP messages not received are detected by an acknowledgment mechanism and retransmitted

Explanation:

PFCP, which operates over UDP, includes an acknowledgment mechanism to detect lost packets. If a message is not acknowledged, 
it is retransmitted to ensure reliable communication between the SMF and UPF69.

S3.DS.Q3: The profile of the subscriber, regarding the characteristics of the sessions he can establish
The correct answer is:

is transmitted to the SMF by the UDM in response to the Nudm_SDM_Get message

Explanation:

During PDU session establishment, the SMF retrieves subscriber profile information from the UDM (Unified Data Management) via
the Nudm_SDM_Get message. This profile includes session characteristics such as QoS parameters and allowed session types78.

S3.DS.Q4: The Nudm_SDM_Subscribe exchange between the SMF and the UDM
The correct answer is:

allows the SMF to be notified if the subscriber's profile changes

Explanation:

The Nudm_SDM_Subscribe procedure enables the SMF to subscribe for notifications from the UDM about changes in a subscriber's profile.
This ensures that any updates to subscription data are promptly communicated to relevant network functions8.

S3.DS.Q5: What is the purpose of exchanging N4 Session-Modification-Request and N4 Session-Modification-Response?
The correct answer is:

Adapt the quality of service of the session to the specific demands of the UE

Explanation:

The N4 Session Modification procedure allows updates to existing PDU session parameters, such as QoS configurations, 
based on changing requirements or demands from the UE. This ensures that service quality aligns with user needs9.

S3.DS.Q6: When is data exchange possible in both directions (see numbers in circles)?
The correct answer is:

instant 4

Explanation:

Data exchange in both directions becomes possible only after all signaling procedures for PDU session establishment are completed, 
which happens at instant 5 when all necessary configurations are finalized.

S3.DS.Q7: Given that the UE is in the RRC-connected state at t=0, which representation of the evolution of the RRC state is correct?
The correct answer is:

C

Explanation:

Based on the operator's strategy, a UE transitions from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_INACTIVE after 10 seconds of inactivity and
then to RRC_IDLE after 50 seconds (10+40 seconds). Representation A accurately reflects this behavior.

S3.DS.Q8: What is the only network function involved during the signaling procedure done at t=58?
The correct answer is:

gNB

Explanation:

At t=58, signaling involves only local interactions between the UE and gNB as part of RRC state transitions or 
context updates. No core network functions like AMF or SMF are involved.

S3.DS.Q9: Which functional entities are involved in the signaling procedure at t=152?
The correct answers are:

AMF
UPF

Explanation:

At t=152, signaling involves both gNB and AMF for procedures like RRC state transitions or NAS signaling updates.
These entities coordinate to manage UE mobility or state changes.

S3.DS.Q10: At t=120, when a UE changes cell and goes to a cell that belongs to a different RNA, what does it do?
The correct answer is:

performs an RRC-resume procedure

Explanation:

When a UE in RRC_INACTIVE moves to a new RNA, it performs an RRC Resume procedure to re-establish its connection with minimal signaling overhead while maintaining its context11
