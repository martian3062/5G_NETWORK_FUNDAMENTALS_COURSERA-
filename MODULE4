 1. CUPS consists of
separating the control and data planes for the nodes concerned by user data flow

 2. In a 5G CUPS architecture, the UPF
applies the routing policy sent by the SMF

3. In CUPS architecture, a UPF
 systematically receives from the SMF a set of rules defining the forwarding and QoS management for each new data flow

Question 1: In CUPS architecture,

Answer: the 32-bit TEID is retained to identify each endpoint of the tunnel but the SEID is added to uniquely identify a session
Explanation: In the CUPS architecture, the 32-bit Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID) is maintained to identify each endpoint of 
the tunnel. Additionally, a 64-bit Session Endpoint Identifier (SEID) is introduced to uniquely identify a session, enhancing the
granularity and management of sessions within the network. 

Question 2: The Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) operates over

Answer: UDP
Explanation: PFCP operates over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It is a signaling protocol used 
for communication between control plane and user plane functions in 4G and 5G networks, facilitating the implementation of
Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS). 

Question 3: A PFCP message sent by an SMF to a UPF

Answer: is never lost because PFCP includes a retransmission process
Explanation: PFCP includes a retransmission mechanism to ensure reliable message delivery. If a PFCP message sent by a 
Session Management Function (SMF) to a User Plane Function (UPF) is not acknowledged, it will be retransmitted
according to the protocol's retransmission strategy. 

Question 4: The association between an SMF and a UPF

Answer: is done when a new SMF or UPF instance is started
Explanation: The association between a Session Management Function (SMF) and a User Plane Function (UPF) is 
established when a new SMF or UPF instance is started. This association is necessary for the SMF to manage sessions
and control the user plane functions effectively.
