 1. CUPS consists of
separating the control and data planes for the nodes concerned by user data flow

 2. In a 5G CUPS architecture, the UPF
applies the routing policy sent by the SMF

3. In CUPS architecture, a UPF
 systematically receives from the SMF a set of rules defining the forwarding and QoS management for each new data flow

Question 1: In CUPS architecture,

Answer: the 32-bit TEID is retained to identify each endpoint of the tunnel but the SEID is added to uniquely identify a session
Explanation: In the CUPS architecture, the 32-bit Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID) is maintained to identify each endpoint of 
the tunnel. Additionally, a 64-bit Session Endpoint Identifier (SEID) is introduced to uniquely identify a session, enhancing the
granularity and management of sessions within the network. 

Question 2: The Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) operates over

Answer: UDP
Explanation: PFCP operates over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It is a signaling protocol used 
for communication between control plane and user plane functions in 4G and 5G networks, facilitating the implementation of
Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS). 

Question 3: A PFCP message sent by an SMF to a UPF

Answer: is never lost because PFCP includes a retransmission process
Explanation: PFCP includes a retransmission mechanism to ensure reliable message delivery. If a PFCP message sent by a 
Session Management Function (SMF) to a User Plane Function (UPF) is not acknowledged, it will be retransmitted
according to the protocol's retransmission strategy. 

Question 4: The association between an SMF and a UPF

Answer: is done when a new SMF or UPF instance is started
Explanation: The association between a Session Management Function (SMF) and a User Plane Function (UPF) is 
established when a new SMF or UPF instance is started. This association is necessary for the SMF to manage sessions
and control the user plane functions effectively.

In CUPS architecture, TEID:

The correct answer is: can be chosen by the SMF or the UPF depending on the configuration choice

Regarding the TEID local to the gNB (to the radio access network):

The correct answer is: chosen by the gNB and transmitted to the UPF via AMF and SMF

1. In 5G, 
PDU session establishment may be done after registering in the network

2. The functional entities necessarily involved in the registration of a UE in the network are:

AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function)
AUSF (Authentication Server Function)
gNB (Next Generation NodeB)
UDM (Unified Data Management)

3. The functional entities necessarily involved in establishing a PDU session are:

AMF
gNB
SMF (Session Management Function)

m3l5
When a UE changes from "CM-idle/RRC-idle" to "CM-connected/RRC-Connected" state:

The following entities exchange messages (in addition to the UE):

AMF

gNB

The AMF and gNB are involved in establishing the NAS signaling connection and RRC connection respectively25. The other entities (AUSF, SMF, UDM, UPF, NRF) are not directly involved in this state transition.

In "RRC-inactive" state, the following connections and tunnels are maintained:

gNB-AMF connection

gNB-UPF tunnel

In RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE context is stored in both the UE and the last serving gNB. The gNB maintains the NG connections (NG-C and NG-U) with the AMF and UPF47.

Reasons for defining a new RRC state (RRC_INACTIVE) in 5G:

To limit the demands on the core network entities, in particular the AMF

To reduce latency when exchanging data after a period of inactivity
