S4.Pr.Q1: Securing 4G radio access is based on
The correct answer is:

symmetric cryptography with keys stored in USIM cards and HSS

Explanation:

4G security relies on symmetric cryptography. The secret keys used for encryption and authentication are securely
stored in the USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) on the UE and in the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) in the network56.

S4.Pr.Q2: A 4G network authenticates a UE
The correct answer is:

by sending a random number and checking that the result calculated by the UE is equal to the expected result

Explanation:

In 4G, the network sends a RAND (random number) to the UE during authentication. The UE calculates 
a response (RES) using its secret key and RAND, which is then compared to the expected result (XRES) computed by the HSS. 
If they match, authentication succeeds567.

S4.Pr.Q3: Two different UEs receive an authentication request simultaneously. By chance, the RAND values 
chosen by the cellular network are the same. Are the RES signed responses identical?
The correct answer is:

No, the probability that the shared secrets of the subscribers coincide is very small ~1/2^128

Explanation:

Even if two UEs receive identical RAND values, their responses (RES) will differ because they use 
different secret keys stored in their USIMs. The likelihood of shared secrets coinciding is extremely low (~1/2^128), making it practically impossible56.

S4.Pr.Q4: In a 4G network
The correct answer is:

the UE authenticates the network and the network authenticates the UE

Explanation:

4G employs mutual authentication, where both the UE and the network verify each other's identities.
The network authenticates the UE using RAND and XRES, while the UE authenticates the network using AUTN (Authentication Token)568.

S4.Pr.Q5: In a 4G network
The correct answer is:

the encryption operation is of equal complexity to the decryption operation

Explanation:

Encryption and decryption in 4G use symmetric algorithms like AES or SNOW 3G, where both
operations involve similar computational complexity910.

S4.Pr.Q6: Integrity control is based on
The correct answer is:

the addition of a short code calculated from a secret key

Explanation:

Integrity control uses a short Message Authentication Code (MAC) derived from a
secret key to ensure data integrity. This MAC is appended to messages and verified by recipients10.

S4.Pr.Q7: The GUTI (Globally Unique Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity)
The correct answer is:

is forged by concatenating the TMSI, the identity of the MME in the network, and the network identity (country code and operator code)

Explanation:

The GUTI includes components such as:

PLMN identity (MCC + MNC)

MME Identity (MMEI)

M-TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity)1112.

S4.Pr.Q8: GUTI is transmitted to a UE
The correct answer is:

after authentication and activation of encryption

Explanation:

The GUTI is transmitted only after successful mutual 
authentication and encryption activation to protect its confidentiality during transmission
