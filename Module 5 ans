S4.Pr.Q1: Securing 4G radio access is based on
The correct answer is:

symmetric cryptography with keys stored in USIM cards and HSS

Explanation:

4G security relies on symmetric cryptography. The secret keys used for encryption and authentication are securely
stored in the USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) on the UE and in the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) in the network56.

S4.Pr.Q2: A 4G network authenticates a UE
The correct answer is:

by sending a random number and checking that the result calculated by the UE is equal to the expected result

Explanation:

In 4G, the network sends a RAND (random number) to the UE during authentication. The UE calculates 
a response (RES) using its secret key and RAND, which is then compared to the expected result (XRES) computed by the HSS. 
If they match, authentication succeeds567.

S4.Pr.Q3: Two different UEs receive an authentication request simultaneously. By chance, the RAND values 
chosen by the cellular network are the same. Are the RES signed responses identical?
The correct answer is:

No, the probability that the shared secrets of the subscribers coincide is very small ~1/2^128

Explanation:

Even if two UEs receive identical RAND values, their responses (RES) will differ because they use 
different secret keys stored in their USIMs. The likelihood of shared secrets coinciding is extremely low (~1/2^128), making it practically impossible56.

S4.Pr.Q4: In a 4G network
The correct answer is:

the UE authenticates the network and the network authenticates the UE

Explanation:

4G employs mutual authentication, where both the UE and the network verify each other's identities.
The network authenticates the UE using RAND and XRES, while the UE authenticates the network using AUTN (Authentication Token)568.

S4.Pr.Q5: In a 4G network
The correct answer is:

the encryption operation is of equal complexity to the decryption operation

Explanation:

Encryption and decryption in 4G use symmetric algorithms like AES or SNOW 3G, where both
operations involve similar computational complexity910.

S4.Pr.Q6: Integrity control is based on
The correct answer is:

the addition of a short code calculated from a secret key

Explanation:

Integrity control uses a short Message Authentication Code (MAC) derived from a
secret key to ensure data integrity. This MAC is appended to messages and verified by recipients10.

S4.Pr.Q7: The GUTI (Globally Unique Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity)
The correct answer is:

is forged by concatenating the TMSI, the identity of the MME in the network, and the network identity (country code and operator code)

Explanation:

The GUTI includes components such as:

PLMN identity (MCC + MNC)

MME Identity (MMEI)

M-TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity)1112.

S4.Pr.Q8: GUTI is transmitted to a UE
The correct answer is:

after authentication and activation of encryption

Explanation:

The GUTI is transmitted only after successful mutual 
authentication and encryption activation to protect its confidentiality during transmission

S4.V4.Q1: The general philosophy of authentication in 5G is

to ensure that authentication is systematically done by the subscriber's home network

Explanation: 5G authentication improves upon 4G by enhancing home-network control1. The AUSF in the home network plays a central role in authenticating the UE
, even when the UE is in a visited network2.

S4.V4.Q2: The calculation of the RES* signed result is performed

in the USIM and the terminal

Explanation: While the search results don't explicitly state this, 5G authentication involves both the USIM card and the terminal (UE) in cryptographic operations3.
The RES* calculation likely involves both components for enhanced security.

S4.V4.Q3: We consider a terminal with a USIM card. It receives an authentication request with a RAND value. It stays in the same network but then changes cells 
and is authenticated again. By chance, the RAND value is the same as before.

The RES* value returned by the UE is the same as before

Explanation: If the RAND value and network remain the same, the cryptographic inputs would be identical, resulting in the same RES* value3.

S4.V4.Q4: We consider a terminal with a USIM card. It receives an authentication request with a RAND value. It then crosses the border and changes network and is authenticated again. 
By chance, the RAND value is the same as before.

The RES* value returned by the UE is different from the previous value 
Explanation: The RES* calculation may incorporate network-specific parameters. Changing networks could potentially affect the result, even with the same RAND23.

S4.V4.Q5: The HXRES* has been defined in 5G

to allow the visited network to pre-authenticate the UE

Explanation: The HXRES* (hash of expected response) is sent to the SEAF (in the visited network) to enable pre-authentication of the UE before full authentication is completed by 
the home network6.

The ARPF provides

a key to the AUSF, which calculates a child key transmitted to the AMF/SEAF, which in turn calculates a "grandchild" key transmitted to the eNB for 
encrypting the data transmitted over the radio channel

Explanation: The ARPF derives KAUSF from the long-term key K and sends it to the AUSF. The AUSF then derives KSEAF and sends it to the SEAF/AMF. 
The SEAF/AMF further derives KAMF, which is used to generate keys for the radio interface (eNB/gNB)158.

S4.V5.Q3: The AMF/SEAF receives a K_SEAF key for a given UE calculated from a RAND. The AMF/SEAF receives a second K_SEAF key for the same UE a little later as a result of an AKA procedure but
purely by chance the RAND value is identical.
the value of K_SEAF' is necessarily DIFFERENT FROM the value of K_SEAF
S4.V5.Q2: The K_SEAF key is

calculated by the AUSF and transmitted to the SEAF

S4.V5.Q4: A UE receives a video streaming after performing the AKA procedure (authentication and encryption activated). 
It changes cell in the middle of the stream.

there is no new AKA procedure but a new encryption key is calculated by the OLD gNB from the previous key transmitted by the NEW gNB

Explanation: The AUSF derives the KSEAF (anchor key) from KAUSF and sends it to the SEAF in the Nausf_UE_Authentication_Authenticate Response message

S4.V6.Q1: A bidding-down attack consists in

forcing the terminal and the network in a negotiation to use a degraded exchange mode

Explanation: A bidding-down attack aims to reduce the security of a mobile network connection by forcing the use of weaker encryption
algorithms or downgrading to prior network generations12. This allows an adversary to exploit vulnerabilities and potentially harm network users.

S4.V6.Q2: To prevent a successful bidding-down attack on the security capabilities of a UE,

These security capabilities are transmitted in clear text by the UE and echoed by the AMF with integrity check protection

Explanation: While the search results don't explicitly state this, it's a common security practice to transmit capabilities in clear text and have them echoed
back with integrity protection to prevent tampering. This allows the UE to verify that its capabilities haven't been altered during transmission.

S4.V6.Q3: A bidding-down attack in 5G

is detected then stopped

Explanation: While bidding-down attacks are still possible in 5G networks, various mitigations have been integrated into the latest 4G and 5G specifications2. These mitigations aim to detect and prevent such attacks, although the effectiveness varies across implementations and devices.
