S4.Pr.Q1: Securing 4G radio access is based on
The correct answer is:

symmetric cryptography with keys stored in USIM cards and HSS

Explanation:

4G security relies on symmetric cryptography. The secret keys used for encryption and authentication are securely
stored in the USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) on the UE and in the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) in the network56.

S4.Pr.Q2: A 4G network authenticates a UE
The correct answer is:

by sending a random number and checking that the result calculated by the UE is equal to the expected result

Explanation:

In 4G, the network sends a RAND (random number) to the UE during authentication. The UE calculates 
a response (RES) using its secret key and RAND, which is then compared to the expected result (XRES) computed by the HSS. 
If they match, authentication succeeds567.

S4.Pr.Q3: Two different UEs receive an authentication request simultaneously. By chance, the RAND values 
chosen by the cellular network are the same. Are the RES signed responses identical?
The correct answer is:

No, the probability that the shared secrets of the subscribers coincide is very small ~1/2^128

Explanation:

Even if two UEs receive identical RAND values, their responses (RES) will differ because they use 
different secret keys stored in their USIMs. The likelihood of shared secrets coinciding is extremely low (~1/2^128), making it practically impossible56.

S4.Pr.Q4: In a 4G network
The correct answer is:

the UE authenticates the network and the network authenticates the UE

Explanation:

4G employs mutual authentication, where both the UE and the network verify each other's identities.
The network authenticates the UE using RAND and XRES, while the UE authenticates the network using AUTN (Authentication Token)568.

S4.Pr.Q5: In a 4G network
The correct answer is:

the encryption operation is of equal complexity to the decryption operation

Explanation:

Encryption and decryption in 4G use symmetric algorithms like AES or SNOW 3G, where both
operations involve similar computational complexity910.

S4.Pr.Q6: Integrity control is based on
The correct answer is:

the addition of a short code calculated from a secret key

Explanation:

Integrity control uses a short Message Authentication Code (MAC) derived from a
secret key to ensure data integrity. This MAC is appended to messages and verified by recipients10.

S4.Pr.Q7: The GUTI (Globally Unique Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity)
The correct answer is:

is forged by concatenating the TMSI, the identity of the MME in the network, and the network identity (country code and operator code)

Explanation:

The GUTI includes components such as:

PLMN identity (MCC + MNC)

MME Identity (MMEI)

M-TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity)1112.

S4.Pr.Q8: GUTI is transmitted to a UE
The correct answer is:

after authentication and activation of encryption

Explanation:

The GUTI is transmitted only after successful mutual 
authentication and encryption activation to protect its confidentiality during transmission

S4.V1.Q1: Compared to a 2G/3G or 4G mobile network, a 5G network is
The correct answer is:

more likely to be attacked as there are many interconnections with other networks or systems

Explanation:

5G networks introduce more interconnections with external systems, such as IoT devices, edge computing, and cloud services.
This increases the attack surface,
making them more vulnerable to cyberattacks compared to earlier generations6712.

S4.V1.Q2: Compared to an attack on a 2G/3G/4G network, an attack on a 5G network
The correct answer is:

may have more serious consequences because the 5G network is a support for many services, some of which involve human lives

Explanation:

5G networks are critical for applications like autonomous vehicles, remote surgeries, and smart cities. Attacks on these networks 
can have severe consequences, including risks to human lives and critical infrastructure568.

S4.V1.Q3: To secure a 5G network
The correct answer is:

all accesses, radio and fixed, must be secured

Explanation:

Securing a 5G network requires a comprehensive approach that includes securing both radio and fixed network accesses. This involves encryption,
authentication, and protection of all interfaces to mitigate vulnerabilities across the entire infrastructure71015.

S4.V2.Q1: The ARPF (Authentication Credential Repository and Processing Function)
The correct answer is:

stores the permanent key of each subscriber and provides the AUSF with keys to derive encryption and integrity keys

Explanation:

The ARPF is responsible for securely storing the subscriber's permanent key and generating authentication vectors. It provides these vectors
to the AUSF, which uses them to derive encryption and integrity keys for secure communication678.

S4.V2.Q2: The ARPF is a function that in practice is performed by
The correct answer is:

UDM

Explanation:

The ARPF is a functional component of the UDM (Unified Data Management) in 5G. It works closely with the AUSF to generate authentication vectors 
based on the subscriber's shared secret key68.

S4.V2.Q3: The ARPF linked to a UE is
The correct answer is:

always in the UE's home network

Explanation:

The ARPF resides in the home network of the UE because it stores the subscriber's permanent authentication credentials, which are managed by the home network operator6711.

S4.V2.Q4: The AUSF (Authentication Server Function)
The correct answer is:

performs authentication and provides authentication vectors that can only be used within the requesting network

Explanation:

The AUSF performs subscriber authentication and generates authentication vectors. These vectors are specific to the requesting network and 
cannot be used by other networks, ensuring security and privacy
