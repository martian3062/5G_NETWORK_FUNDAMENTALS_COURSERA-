The 5G core network is based on:

on a service-based architecture

Explanation: The 5G core network utilizes a cloud-aligned, service-based architecture (SBA) that spans across all 5G functions and interactions137.

Consider an SMF and a UE that is engaged in a PDU session activation procedure. The SMF dialogues with other NF network functions. It behaves:

alternately as client and server

Explanation: In the service-based architecture of 5G, network functions can act as both service consumers and producers, allowing the SMF to behave alternately as a client and server when interacting with other network functions37.

Between the SMF and the PCF, is defined:

the reference point N7

Explanation: While the search results don't explicitly mention the N7 reference point between SMF and PCF, in 5G core architecture, network functions are typically connected via standardized reference points. The N7 reference point is the standard interface between SMF and PCF.

A service of a network function is accessible via:

an API (Application Programming Interface)

Explanation: In the 5G core service-based architecture, network functions expose their services through HTTP-based APIs, replacing protocols like Diameter used in previous generations37.

S5.V2.Q2: The general philosophy behind the specification of SBI interfaces is

to focus on readability and scalability of messages

The 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA) and Service-Based Interfaces (SBI) are
designed to enhance flexibility and scalability of 5G networks. They allow for easy introduction of new services and dynamic interaction between network functions2.

S5.V2.Q3: A fundamental aspect of REST is

to provide a uniform interface for handling resources

RESTful principles are employed in designing service-based interfaces in 5G. REST (Representational State Transfer) provides a uniform interface for handling resources,
which aligns with the service-based architecture of 5G networks2.

S5.V2.Q4: Each resource is accessible by

its URI

In RESTful architectures, resources are typically accessed via their Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)28.

S5.V2.Q5: Which string represents a possible URI in 5G

The correct answer is not explicitly provided in the search results. However, based on RESTful principles and 5G naming conventions, a plausible URI format would be:

http://5Goperator/nudm-sdm/v2/imsi-208-10-12345678/smf-select-data

This format includes the operator domain, the network function (nudm-sdm), version (v2), subscriber identifier (IMSI), and the specific resource (smf-select-data).

S5.V3.Q1: CRUD means

the 4 basic operations Create, Read, Update, Delete that allow interaction with a database

CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four fundamental operations for persistent storage and database management19.

S5.V3.Q2: To read the status of a resource in an NF, you must send it

an HTTP GET method

In RESTful APIs, which are used in 5G core network communications, the GET method is used to retrieve or read resource information9.

S5.V3.Q3: An instance of an NF function (e.g. UDM)

can memorise a context but this is done through the creation of a resource that will correspond to this context

While the search results don't directly address this question, based on the service-based architecture of 5G and RESTful principles, network functions can maintain state through resources. When context needs 
to be stored, it's typically done by creating a resource that represents that context, allowing for stateful interactions within a generally stateless architecture.

S5.V4.Q1: We consider a 5G network operational at a given time. Select the correct statement.

There are one or more instances of AMF, SMF, AUSF and UDM running

In a 5G network, multiple instances of network functions can exist to support scalability and load balancing38.

S5.V4.Q2: An NRF instance

Allows an NF instance to get the list of the instances providing a given NF service

The Network Repository Function (NRF) discovers network function instances and provides information about available NF instances and their supported services24.

S5.V4.Q3: The list of NF instances is known to the NRF instance (2 possible methods)

because each instance registers with the NRF when it activates and deregisters when it stops

because the operator has registered them in the NRF instance

NF instances register with the NRF when they come up2. Additionally, operators can configure NF instances locally3.

S5.V4.Q4: The way to reach an NF instance is indicated by the NRF in the form (select 2 answers)

an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)

a symbolic name or FQDN

The NRF provides endpoint information such as IP addresses and FQDNs for NF instances34.

S5.V4.Q5: The uniqueness of the identity of an instance

is ensured by a random draw mechanism by each instance on a large number of bits

Each NF instance is identified by a Network Function Instance ID (NFInstanceID), which is modeled as a Unique Universal Identifier (UUID)3. 
UUIDs are typically generated using random or pseudo-random algorithms to ensure uniqueness.
